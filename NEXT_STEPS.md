# Next Steps: Evolutionary Farming Simulator

## Immediate Tasks

### 1. Core Plant System
- [ ] Implement basic plant class with genetic traits
- [ ] Create plant growth and life cycle mechanics
- [ ] Design simple genetics system for trait inheritance
- [ ] Implement basic plant rendering

### 2. World Simulation
- [ ] Create 2D grid-based world
- [ ] Implement basic environmental factors (sunlight, water, nutrients)
- [ ] Add day/night cycle
- [ ] Create simple weather system

### 3. Basic Interaction
- [ ] Implement player controls for camera movement
- [ ] Add ability to select and inspect plants
- [ ] Create basic gardening tools (water, harvest, plant)

## Technical Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Systems
1. **Plant Class**
   - Genetic traits (growth rate, size, color, etc.)
   - Life cycle stages (seed, sprout, mature, flowering, etc.)
   - Resource management (water, nutrients, energy)

2. **World Class**
   - Grid management
   - Environmental simulation
   - Time management

3. **Rendering System**
   - Basic 2D rendering of plants and environment
   - Simple UI for game controls
   - Debug visualization

### Phase 2: Simulation Features
1. **Genetics**
   - Trait inheritance
   - Mutation system
   - Cross-breeding mechanics

2. **Ecosystem**
   - Plant competition for resources
   - Basic environmental effects
   - Simple weather system

3. **Player Tools**
   - Basic gardening tools
   - Plant inspection UI
   - Time controls (pause, speed up, slow down)

## Getting Started with Development

1. Set up your development environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the current development version:
   ```bash
   python -m evolutionary_farming_sim.main
   ```

3. Run tests (once we have them):
   ```bash
   pytest
   ```

## Contributing
1. Create a new branch for your feature: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
2. Make your changes and commit them: `git commit -m "Add your feature"`
3. Push to the branch: `git push origin feature/your-feature-name`
4. Create a pull request

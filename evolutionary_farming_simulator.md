# Evolutionary Farming Simulator

A 2D/3D hybrid simulation game where players cultivate and guide the evolution of plant life in a dynamic ecosystem.

## Project Vision
Create an engaging simulation where players can:
- Guide plant evolution through selective breeding
- Discover emergent symbiotic relationships
- Balance ecosystem health with agricultural productivity
- Experience the results in both 2D (strategy) and 3D (first-person) views

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Core Simulation (2D)
**Milestone 1: Basic Plant System**
- [ ] 2D grid world with basic rendering

- [ ] Simple visualization of plant states

**Milestone 2: Environmental Systems**
- [ ] Day/night cycle
- [ ] Basic weather patterns
- [ ] Soil moisture and nutrients
- [ ] Simple terrain types

**Milestone 3: Evolution Mechanics**
